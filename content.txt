A function is really just another way of writing an equation. A function is  a way to analyse two unrelated set of numbers.
Functions are a way of writing a process that happens to a number. For example, if I wanted to multiply my original number by 3, then subtract 6, I could write it as this function:f(x) = 3x-6.
So if my original number was 10:f(10) = 3(10)-6f(10) = 30-6f(10) = 24
Or if the original number was -12f(-12) = 3(-12)-6f(-12) = -36-6f(-12) = -42
In the exam, they may phrase this type of question as "Evaluate f(10)" or "Evaluate f(-12)". This is the same type of question as shown above.
For the questions below, lets use these two functions:f(x) = 2x+3g(x) = 7-4x
1) What is gf(4)?This is the same as g(f(4)).So first, lets find f(4):f(4) = 2(4)+3f(4) = 8+3f(4) = 11Now we need to find g(11)g(11) = 7-4(11)g(11) = 7-44g(11) = -37Answer = -37
2) Evaluate f²(2)This is the same as f(f(2))So first, lets find f(2)f(2) = 2(2)+3f(2) = 4+3f(2) = 7Now we need to find f(7)f(7) = 2(7)+3f(7) = 14+3f(7) = 17Answer = 17
3) Solve f(x)=2g(x)We need to substitute in f(x) and g(x), then simplify:2x+3 = 2(7-4x)2x+3 = 14-8xTo find x, we need to make it the subject:10x+3=14 [added 8x]10x=11 [subtracted 3]x=1.1 [divided by 10]Answer = 1.1
Inverse Functions are the reverse of normal functions. For example, I have the function 2x+3. This function gives me the answer when I input a number. But what if I wanted to find the original number from the answer? Say I have the answer of 49. I now want to know the function that would lead me to the original number - in other words, the inverse function of 2x+3:First, let y=2x+3. Then make x the subject of this equation:y=2x+32x=y-3x=(y-3)÷2Then, substitute the 'x' for a 'f^-1(x)' and the 'y' for an 'x' to get the inverse function:f^-1(x) = (x-3)÷2Since we already had the answer of 49, we place it in our inverse function to calculate the original number:(49-3)÷246÷2 = 23Answer = 23Use this method to get the inverse function or the original number
